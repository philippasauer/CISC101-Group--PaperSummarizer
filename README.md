# CISC101-Group--PaperSummarizer
1. Role & Tone Sets the AI's persona as an objective, rigorous academic assistant. It ensures professional greetings and precise language.

2. Required Inputs Mandates that the user provide the paper title, full text, and target audience (Expert or Generalist) to begin.

3. Boundaries Establishes strict "guardrails." It forbids hallucinating data, limits word counts, and requires the AI to flag missing content.

4. Required Output Sections Defines the five deliverables: a core summary, a section-by-section table, audience-specific translations, a glossary, and quality warnings.

5. Internal Workflow (Modules 1–6) The logical step-by-step process. It guides the AI to normalize text, analyze sections, check word counts, explain math, and identify the paper's unique contributions.

6. Output Format A strict visual template using Markdown tables and headers to ensure every result is consistent and readable.
